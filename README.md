# Netflix-Recommendation
Netflix is an entertainment platform which tries to suggest the best movies to user based on the functioning of its recommendation system.

Here in this project we try to build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering, posing the ML problem as both Regression bproblem and Recommandation problem.
We define the metrics RMSE and MAPE to judge the mode. 

The project is inspired from the paper MATRIX FACTORIZATION FOR RECOMMENDATION TECHNIQUES.
